Memory management types: 

1. Garbage Collection => No Err + Easy/Fast Write | Large + Slow run + No Control.
   java | c# and all modern lagn.
  NOTE: garbage collectore automatically cleans its memory afer some time. everyting loads again for 1st time.

2. Memory management  => too many Error + Hard/Slow Write | Small + Fast run + Full Controll.
    C | C++ 

3. Ownership Model    => No Err* + someWhat Hard and Slowest write | Small + Fast run + vary much Controll (memory safe so its automatic).
    Rust = compail time memory check feature. (with 'unsafe' we can overwrite this.) Borrow checker.

     *  while protram is compaliling  2,3,4 are calcualted.
     *  while proram is runnigng the stack is changing while code and static/global stays.
     *  while Fucntion is running its stack frame is changing after fun die  stack frame die.
     * DX:
     *  1. Stack = Call by Value. = value is in stack.
     *  2. Heap = Call by reference = valuse is in Heap but pointer is in stack.
     *  3. In C/C++ we allocate the memory from Heap with 'maloc/new' and dealocate with 'free/delete'
     *  4. Dealocation is very very important in HEAP. because it is under our controll so unless we
     *     clean it it will not get cleaned itself.
     *  5. In stack the functions are arranged in order of their exicuaiotn Main is at lowest.
     *  6. After main load it starts exicution of instide it.
     *  7. As soon as a function is called inside the main it loads above Main , and if there si
     *     another funciton inside that function it loads above that funcito. and soo on.
     *  8. Allways the topmost function is running while the billow are waiting for the exicution
     *     and resualt returning.
     *  9. As one Fn ends the stack is cleared, with stack every Var, Arguments, and returntyps are
     *     cleared inside the "STACK FRAME".
     *  10.Unlike heap stack is 1.FiXED ins size, 2.Running while protram is running, 3.Cleans its
     *     own stuffs.

a. pushing in stack is faster > allocating memory in heap.
b. accessing data in stack is faster > on Heap ( because pointer is stored in stack and it points to words the Heap)
