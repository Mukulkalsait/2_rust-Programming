Memory management types: 

1. Garbage Collection => No Err + Easy/Fast Write | Large + Slow run + No Control.
   java | c# and all modern lagn.
  NOTE: garbage collectore automatically cleans its memory afer some time. everyting loads again for 1st time.

2. Memory management  => too many Error + Hard/Slow Write | Small + Fast run + Very Much Controll(memory safe so its automatic).
    C | C++ 

3. Ownership Model    => No Err* + someWhat Hard and Slowest write | Small + Fast run + Full Controll.
    Rust = compail time memory check feature. (with 'unsafe' we can overwrite this.) Borrow checker.
